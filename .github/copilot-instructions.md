 - [x] Scaffold the Project (Added platformio.ini, src/main.cpp, README.md)
 - [x] Customize the Project (Interrupt-driven quadrature decode + EMA speed, edge-blended velocity)
 - [x] Install Required Extensions (PlatformIO IDE optional - skipped, user may install manually)
 - [x] Compile the Project (Build succeeded with PlatformIO)
 - [x] Create and Run Task (Added .vscode/tasks.json for build/upload/monitor)
